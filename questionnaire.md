# Questionnaire:

1. Are there any sub-optimal choices( or short cuts taken due to limited time ) in your implementation?
2. Is any part of it over-designed? ( It is fine to over-design to showcase your skills as long as you are clear about it)
3. If you have to scale your solution to 100 users/second traffic what changes would you make, if any?
4. What are some other enhancements you would have made, if you had more time to do this implementation


1. Not any that I can think of, I am less familiar with React so I tried to be as thorough as possible, with most of my experience being in React Native. 

2. I do not believe any part of my webpage has been overdesigned, I tried to make things as conscise as possible while trying to stick to best React practices.

3. To scale my webpage, Instead of having the user trigger the API call whenever a user visits, the backend will fire the API call every 30/60 seconds, store the results in the back-end, and then when a user visits the website, just pull my data stored on the back-end.

4. If I had more time to work on this, I would have made the webpage look a bit more inviting, possibly adding some color to the lines, icons for the cryptos, as well as some fine tuning things
